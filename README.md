# End of Module Assignment: e-Portfolio
Security and Risk Management

In this module I have learned few knowledge, first one is Risk Management Process, this is a important thing as a management process of minimizing risk in a project or enterprise, here are four steps of Risk Management Process.
1. Identification of Risks
2. Risk Assessment
3. Risk Management Approach
4. Risk Management Effect Evaluation

In seminars discussion I also understand the OWASP cookbook and the Mitre ATT&CK database.
The focus of MITER ATT&CK is on Phases and Activities. So, in MITER ATT&CK, TTP is his focus. TTP are Tactic, Technique and Procedure respectively. When attackers have a strategic goal, such as data theft or the establishment of reward mechanisms and backdoors in your network, they will use many different tactics at different stages to attack you. There will be some technical activities and techniques in each stage, and each technical activity will have its own certain procedures and steps. Therefore, before the attackers achieve their goals, they will routinely carry out these combined attacks in order to achieve their goals.

In the framework matrix of MITER ATT&CK, the tactics are the headings of each column, the techniques are the lists within the headings, and the final procedure is the detailed description and operation method of the technique, as shown in the figure below:
 

e-Portfolio Activity – GDPR Case Studies
I picked the 2018 Case Study 1: Prosecution of Guerin Media Limited
In this case Guerin Media Limited is sending unsolicited marketing emails to any complainant without their consent, and these complaints cannot un-subscribe the marketing emails.
Finally, The DPC decided to prosecute Guerin Media Limited for 42 separate breaches of the Electronic Privacy Regulations.
The indictment was filed in Nass District Court on February 5, 2018, and the company pleaded guilty to four sample counts of the 42 charges. Three of the sample charges involved sending unsolicited marketing emails to individuals without their consent, in breach of section 13(1) of the e - Privacy Regulations. A fourth sample allegation concerns a breach of Section 13(12)(c) of the e - Privacy Regulations for failing to include an opt-out mechanism in marketing emails. The court found Guerin Media Limited guilty of all four charges and imposed four fines of €1,000 each, for a total of €4,000. The company has six months to pay the fine.
For this case it was inspire me that if this is happened in my organization, as an Information Security Manager I will have some action to mitigate the issue
First, I will setup an Electronic Direct Mail (EDM) system, marketing mail will only send for registered to be company members and subscribed to agree receive the marketing mail, and the members can through the mail un-subscribe link to request not receive the marketing mail anymore.
Then as an Information Security Manager I will ask the company staff pay attention to Electronic Privacy Policy; IT department will need to provide more training for the internal staff for this knowledge.
Reflections on evaluation of the final project
In this module, group project I was worked with my group members to discuss for the topic and create the content, we discuss and work together in the chat group and shared the knowledge, we discussed for the risk assessments, STRIDE, DREAD, OWASP threat modeling CookBook, ATT&CK libraries, it’s great brainstorm for the project.
Reflections the impact on my professional/personal development.
As I’m also working IT industry in fintech company as a services engineer, this module case studies is a very good impact for me to develop my professional development, for example, our duty work will always receive end user request for internet assess exception, software additional installation, for this we also need to ask user submit helpdesk ticket, get department head approval, and let IT security team review and scan any risk before take action, after this module and the case studies discussion, it will let me sense the security issues as soon as possible and flagging to cyber security team or risk team due the duty.  
Otherwise, if IT department not have any security policy and risk assessment, it will let company exposure risk, subject to legal responsibility and incur losses, so that was a important thing become current trend in various industries.
